# Quake Command Archive

This project archives all releases by **Quake Command** for Quake 1.

**Quake Command** was a website `nuc.net/quake/` that hosted QuakeC modifications for Quake in late 1996. The site was operated by and mods were developed by Steve Bond aka "Wedge" and John Guthrie "Choryoth". Both developers joined Valve to work on Half-Life in late 1996 based on their work shared on Quake Command.

The Quake Command modifications are an important part of Quake history as they are among the first impressive modifications of the game. This project seeks to document and preserve all releases shared on Quake Command. Very little of the `nuc.net/quake/` website and files were archived, therefore the releases must be reconstructed from secondary sources (e.g. Quake news, USENET posts, magazine CDs, etc.).

What is it?
-----------
DEMO CHARGES is a new PROGS.DAT (made with QuakeC) that adds a new weapon
to Quake - remotely detonated bombs that adhere to any wall, floor, or
ceiling. You may plant several of these charges around in a level then run
to safe distance and set them all off! (There is a limited range, so don't
run too far from your goodies or they won't go off.)


Installation/Use:
-----------------
1. Make a directory in your Quake directory called DEMOCHRG.

2. Copy the PROGS.DAT file from this archive into the DEMOCHRG directory.

3. Copy the CONFIG.CFG from your ID1 directory to the DEMOCHRG directory
   and add the following lines:

        BIND [ "IMPULSE 32"
        BIND ] "IMPULSE 33"

   (You may change [ and ] to whichever keys you choose)

4. Start Quake by typing "QUAKE -GAME DEMOCHRG".

5. While playing , press [ to throw  demo charges and ] to detonate the
   charges (you may throw/detonate as many charges as you wish - take note:
   it takes 6 rockets to throw one demo charge).

6. If you find a charge that someone else has planted, you may pick it up
   by touching it. If you pick up someone else's charge, they can no longer
   detonate it - the charge is yours. (Make sure no one is watching and
   waiting to blow you to chunder.)


Notes:
------
You can only pick up a demo charge that is sitting still. You cannot catch
them in mid air.

Demo charges arm one second after you throw them.

You may only throw one demo charge every second.


Known Problems:
---------------
This seems to be a very robust patch. I've tested it at length, both in
single and multiplayer games. However:

If a charge hits a player or monster while it (the charge) is still moving,
it will go through the player/monster. This is a byproduct of the mods I made
so that you could pick these things after someone else drops them.

I dunno if this is a problem, but any charges you lay will belong to you even
if you die. So you can die, respawn, and detonate the charges that you laid
before you died.

If you find any problems, please EMail me.

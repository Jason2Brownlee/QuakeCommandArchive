What is it?
-----------
If you do not play multiplayer games, this patch is useless to you.

Shove off! Is an add-on that I made for quake (With QuakeC) that lets you
shove other players around. (Doesn't seem to work with monsters, but I
made this patch with Deathmatch/CoOp in mind anyway) Seems that in COOP games
or team Deathmatch games, a teammate will sometimes pin you in a corner or
block up a doorway (purely by accident, usually) and get you killed. With
SHOVE OFF, you can push them out of the way without inflicting any damage on
them. It's also great for sneaking up on a deathmatch opponent that is
sniping from a ledge or rooftop. Just give them a good shove if they are over
lava or slime and they go into the drink.

Installation:
-------------
1. In your Quake directory, make a directory called SHOVE

2. Copy the PROGS.DAT file from this archive into the SHOVE directory

3. Copy the CONFIG.CFG file from the ID1 directory into the SHOVE directory
   and add the following line:

                BIND SPACE "IMPULSE 20"
                (space makes the spacebar the shove key. You may use
                 whichever key you prefer)

4. Start Quake by typing QUAKE -GAME SHOVE

5. While playing, push the SPACEBAR (or whichever key you configured) to
   shove other players around (provided you are close enough).

6. This patch is designed for multiplayer games. Only the computer acting
   as the server has to have this patch! Clients need only bind a key to
   IMPULSE 20 to make use of the patch.


Notes:
------
The 'shoving' of the other players is caused by a small, silent, invisible
radius explosion that does no damage. The explosion radiates from the player
that triggered it, the explosion also IGNORES the player that triggered it.

You may also use this patch in COOP games to get over certain obstacles. If
you have a teammate stand in front of you and jump up, you can shove them
through the air. This is useful for spanning gaps or jumping up into
windows, etc.

Known Problems:
---------------
Well, the only 'problem' I can think of is that the shove is caused by a
radius damage call... which 'shoves' everyone within a certain radius. This
means that you can shove someone when your back is turned to them.

Another 'feature' of this patch... you can and will shove everyone within the
effective radius, so it's possible to shove 2 or 3 or more people at the
same time.

Any other problems? Do something really interesting with this patch? EMail me.


Hi!

Just a quick note on the release of the EJECT source code.

The only modified .QC files are

WEAPONS.QC
PROGS.SRC

and of course, the addition of EJECT.QC


The model and sound have been included with this package - I will not get
into documenting how to recompile this. I am simply too busy. This is a
simple patch, and the code itself should help. Email any questions to
wedge@nuc.net


Thanks!

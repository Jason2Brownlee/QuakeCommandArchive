Quake Flares 1.0

Check out QUAKE COMMAND!  http://www.nuc.net/quake
--------------------------------------------------

This is a .DAT file that gives you flares similar to the flares in Descent.
These are spike-shaped flares that you shoot into a wall/floor/ceiling to
light up dark areas (excellent for marking a teams' position/path in COOP
games, too). The flares give off a dim light when you fire them, and shortly
after they stick in the wall they will sizzle and spark to life, brightly
illuminating the area around it. After 7 or so seconds at full burn the flare
will dim again, and 15 seconds later it will burn out.



Installation/Use
----------------

1. In your QUAKE directory make a directory named FLARES

2. Copy the PROGS.DAT file from this archive into the FLARES directory

3. Copy the CONFIG.CFG from your ID1 directory into the FLARES directory and
   add the following line:

   bind f "impulse 30"
   (you may replace 'f' with the key you wish to have fire flares)

4. Start Quake by typing QUAKE -GAME FLARES

5. When in Quake, hit 'f' (or whichever key you bound to impulse 30) to launch
   a flare.


Notes:
------
It doesn't matter which weapon you are currently using when you fire flares.
I never intended to make a flare gun for Quake. Just flares that are handy
and quick to deploy.

You can only fire one flare every half-second. This is partly to keep from
accidently launching two flares at a time. Also, light-rendering in Quake tends
to take a little time, especially with bright lights; so I imposed the limit
to keep you from going ape shit flinging flares everywhere and slowing your
game to a crawl.

I didn't want to put a cap on how many flares could be burning at once, cause
I never know when you might need just *ONE* more flare. Just use your better
judgement. Sample how slow your game gets when you launch a couple in the
same room.

Flares will do one hit point of damage if you hit a monster/player with them.

Flares will disappear if they hit a DOOR or PLAT. They simple cause too many
problems when they are allowed to stick to these things.

Known Problems:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you fire a flare while standing waist or chest deep in water, it will
sometimes disappear, and other times it will hit down the way a bit from you.
(You'll see what I mean) I cannot find any code in weapons.qc to dictate that
spikes should be treated differently when you are standing in water. I'll
look into it.

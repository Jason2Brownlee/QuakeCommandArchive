Throwing Axe MDL        - Choryoth
===========================================================================

Changes Since FIRST Release:
----------------------------
When you press one, throwing axe is selected before regular axe, not
after.

Selecting regular axe when out of throwing axes bug is fixed.

Throwing Axes now work with the CYCLE WEAPONS command

Three hurt sounds now instead of just one. Not as repititious.
(Groovy sounds from QTEST)

When you run out of throwing axes, defaults to regular axe, not shotgun.

Larger bounding box - axes don't sink into the floor, and they are easier
to pick up.

Anyone who dies and has at least one throwing axe will leave ONE (only one)
throwing axe in their backpack.

Axes are removed if they bounce more than 22 times. This eliminates the
axes that get stuck in weird places and ring like alarm clocks.

DO NOT let a throwing axe spank you on the head... they'll mess you up badly.


The long-awaited throwing axe is here! You spawn with one, and you can pick
it up after you throw it. You can also collect axes that other people throw
(DO NOT touch them until they stop moving!!!) so it's possible to have
several throwing axes at one time. Don't bitch about only getting one to
start with. Wait till you see what this thing does to people.


Installation:
-------------
It's easy. No messy impulses!

1) Make a directory off of your QUAKE directory called THROWAXE

2) Copy the PAK0.PAK from this archive into THROWAXE

3) Play Quake by typing QUAKE -GAME THROWAXE


While playing, hit 1. Quake will say "Throwing Axe". Hit 1 again and Quake
will say "Normal Axe!" now hit your mouse button. Now go get your axe. Repeat.

Notes:
------
Throwing axes are NOT your normal axe. You will always have your normal axe
even if you just threw your last throwing axe.

IMPULSE9 will give you 100 throwing axes along with all the other stuff. For
those of you who wanna play Davy Crockett with the monsters.

You can plug people on the rebound too. The throwing axes bounce after they
hit something... they do less damage if you bash someone with a bouncing axe.

No dammit, I will not make the throwing axe return to you. Walk your lazy ass
over and pick it up.


Known Problems:
---------------
I've fixed six problems that were EMailed to me. Thanks guys.

Email me if you discover any (more) problems.

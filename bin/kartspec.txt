(http://www.nuc.net/quake/quakec) this is not a preview or otherwise playable version of Quake Kart, it is a mere 
specifications sheet for prospective Quake Kart project participants. It belongs online ONLY at Quake Command. Thanks!

(Quake webmasters -> please stick with us on this one.)

IF you have retrieved this file from a source other than Quake Command, please ask the administrator of the source to remove
this file from their site, or contact me (wedge@nuc.net).


I'm not trying to make this seem like something all high and mighty... it's actually quite the opposite: a rough technical
draft of the Quake Karts map specifications. Should I need to make an important update or bug fix, it would be a hell of a
lot easier if this file is only available from our Web Site. This ensures that everyone has access to the latest QK map 
information, and won't have to wonder whether or not an unauthorized mirror site has the latest specifications. 


Now we begin:


(Any reference to a MAP, TRACK, or LEVEL in this text means "A Quake Kart Track")

Before I begin, I must explain some basic guidelines concerning submission of your work to our project:



Legalities of sorts:
--------------------
Quake Karts will NOT be a shareware, commercial, or otherwise profit-earning release. Quake Command does not intend or expect 
to earn proft from the Quake Karts project. Just as every other Quake Command project, Quake Karts will be completely and 
totally free to anyone that wants to download it. If an opportunity to make money from Quake Karts is presented to us, the 
offer will be declined. (Job offers, on the other hand...). This is because the entire project will belong to ALL of those 
who have contributed their effort to the final product. 

If we are approached by anyone expressing interest in publishing Quake Karts on floppy disk, CDRom, or any other form of
media, we will only cooperate if the media will be given away at no charge, or included with the purchase of a computer
based magazine. Neither of these options will earn any money for Quake Command as a result of the Quake Kart project.

By now you get the point... we aren't out to make a buck. We won't be making bucks. Obviously, this means we are not offering
money to anyone for work contributed to our project. Written credit will be provided in full in the Quake Karts README file.
We'll list each Track by name, and provide the author's full name, nick, and email address. You aren't going to be shopping
for light bulbs and Hawaiin Punch in WalMart and find QUAKE KART on a CDRom next to the checkout counter. If your level is 
included in the Quake Kart project, it will surely be seen by many, many people... hell, you might even be famous. But none
of us will make a dime.

** If someone approaches us with the proverbial "Offer we can't refuse", we'll contact all level authors to settle
authorization and compensation issues before even making a move. This means, if we are paid, you are paid. But I don't see
this happening. Quake Karts was begun as a non-profit project, and it is our full intent to finish it that way.


Don't Get Your Feelings Hurt:
-----------------------------
Submission of a level does not guarantee that your level will appear in Quake Karts. We reserve full rights to decline levels
for any reason. 

EVERY level submitted will be fully inspected and you will receive feedback from us. We'll pat your back or point out areas
that may need some work. 

This is a daring undertaking on your part. I can explain as much as possible in this text, but there are some things you 
just don't know about the karts and the way they behave. I'm not prepared to release an Alpha or Beta for the purpose of 
demonstrating the Karts- I'm sorry. Please read this text carefully and pay special attention to topics that I say may change
or be added in the future.

If you so choose, send me a level that's only 1/3rd or 1/2 done... this will give me a chance to point out potential trouble
spots for you and offer some suggestions.


Misc:
-----
When submitting a not-yet-complete level for inspection, please ZIP the BSP file using the -ex option (extra compression)
please ensure that only one file is in each ZIP, and do not include .MAP files.

FINAL SUBMISSION - When you submit your finished level, please ZIP the .BSP and .MAP files together (We need the .MAP file
to examine the custom entities and ensure that they are set up properly)

You are responsible for running LIGHT and VIS on your levels (You must do both! We will not include FULLBRIGHT or 
vis-problematic levels!) 


Deadlines:
----------
There is not much work left to be done in Quake Karts (on our end). Barring redesign, only 40% of the code remains and some
 custom MDLs and graphics still need to be done. I'd like to start seeing some levels by the 28th Of October.




Now, I'll try to cover everything you'll need to know to build ass stompin QKart tracks. Read carefully!


KART PHYSICS:
-------------
(Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about the Karts and their behavior - and my answers)

	Q:How Fast do the karts go?

	A:Roughly 1/2 the speed of a missile, at maximum throttle speed. 75% of a missile's speed when the Fifth Gear
	  powerup is in use. Do not make special concerns for karts that are using the Fifth Gear (speed) powerup. 
	  do not make ramps or other areas that REQUIRE the Fifth Gear powerup to negotiate an obstacle. Not everyone
	  will have the powerup. I will release a QuakeC modification very soon that will launch karts out of a rocket
	  launcher. These karts will move along the track at the same speed as a kart that is driving at full throttle.


	Q:How far do karts jump? 

	A:Look at the ramp in KART3.MAP. This ramp directly follows a turn, and is usually jumped at slightly less than full
	  speed, and karts always land in the middle of the landing ramp. I'm going to expand the jumping capacity a bit- 
	  what you see on Kart3.map is hardly an adrenaline-pumping jump. Expect to roughly double that distance at full 
	  speed when building your map.	(Kart3.map is included in this archive)


	Q:How steep can ramps be?

	A:Do not make any ramps steeper than 45 degrees.


	Q:Do the karts take damage from falls? If so - How much, and how far do they have to fall?
	
	A:Yes, the karts do take damage from a fall. Damage will be taken from any fall that is about 1 and a half times 
	  farther than you must fall in (normal) Quake to make the player take damage. The damage inflicted is based directly
	  on the distance fallen. Due to this feature, try to provide a landing ramp or elevated track section where anyone
	  jumping a ramp will be landing. On the other hand, feel free to make bottomless pits of death for those who may
	  miss their jump. Damage taken on an 'average' fall will be between 5-15 points. (Not random, just considering the
	  average height range that most tracks will be built within)


	Q:What happens when a Kart falls a long distance, but doesn't 'break'?

	A:Karts that fall from average or great heights (jumps, etc) will bounce a bit upon landing. This is a realism 
	  feature. Keep this in mind when building track on the downside of a ramp, or under a track section that has no 
	  sidewalls or has low overhead clearance. Some karts may fall into this area and bounce. For example, tunnels 
	  DIRECTLY after a high ramp are  a bad idea, as some karts may be bouncing and won't be able to go through the 
	  tunnel until they've hit the ground again.


	Q:How bad do the karts slide when you take a corner too fast?

	A:Examine the corners in my KART3.MAP. At top speed, all corners can be safely turned, but karts turning these 
	  corners at high speed will most likely be close to the outside wall at the end of the slide. Making your turns
	  signifigantly more narrow than the ones in KART3.MAP will force drivers to slow down going into the turn to avoid
	  sliding and smacking into a wall, which would make them lose speed and possibly bounce out of control. 


	Q:Can karts 'ram' other karts? 

	A:This feature is in the works right now. It looks as if you will only be able to ram karts with the front of your
	  kart. If two karts collide side-by-side, both will lose some speed as a result of the collision, and the karts will
	  bounce slightly away from each other. On the other hand, if you slam the front of your kart into the side or rear
	  end of another kart, you will send the other kart careening back from whence they came. 



IMPORTANT- SURFACE ANGLES:
--------------------------
Karts will be able to drive up almost any surface that is not at an acute or right angle to the track. (This means the karts
can drive up almost any wall that is not vertical or does not lean 'in' towards the track)

Picture that you are standing behind a kart that is driving straight away from you, down a track. Pay attention to the 
angle of the sidewalls (viewed in crossection) in each situation:

( X = Kart, viewed from behind )

|____X____| 
Vertical sidewalls. This is fine. The kart cannot drive up the vertical walls. 


/____X____\ 
Concave sidewalls, this is fine, the kart cannot drive up walls that lean in towards the track.


\____X____/ 
Convex sidewalls. If these are not almost vertical, the kart can drive up them almost regardless of the angle. You can use
this as a 'feature' if you built something like you see below... otherwise avoid convex sidewalls.


|__X__        __X__|
      \___X__/ 
There are three road surfaces that can be driven on, but there are vertical sidewalls at the highest points to keep karts 
from driving up and off of the track.

So, this probably sounds like a stupid way to do things, huh? This situation exists because I have not totally given up on
making full 360 degree inverted loops. In order to achieve this, I have to allow karts to drive 'up' any surface that is 
not totally vertical. I'm not saying that inverted loops WILL be in Quake Kart, so don't go building them yet.


Inclines/Hills:

When a kart is driving up a hill, I have taken care to ensure that all four wheels stay in contact with the road surface.
This means that a kart driving up a hill, ramp, or other incline will have the same angle as the incline.

(picture this as a side view)
	    /
	   /
Kart --> //
	 /
	/   <--- Incline


When karts fly off of a ramp, the nose of the kart points up at the angle of the ramp. As the kart flies and loses vertical
momentum, the nose will slowly tilt down to level off, and as the kart comes down, the nose will point downwards. This is 
a very nice effect, and makes seeing another kart jumping a ramp very convincing. This works on a smaller scale also if you 
were to make a physically bumpy road surface... i.e. offroad area.

The karts will NOT tilt to match angle if the track tilts such that the left wheels would be higher or lower than the right
wheels. (I am working on this now) for now, this means no banked turns, etc.



Custom Entities:
----------------
There are only 2 custom entities in Quake Kart right now... the finish line and the checkpoint. Let me explain.

The Checkpoint:
In order to prevent cheating, I had to devise a system to make sure drivers were driving the entire course and not trying 
to do stupid stuff like cross the finish line by turning around and driving the wrong direction. That is what the checkpoint
entity is for. You must place a checkpoint roughly half-way through your track. The checkpoint is a completely invisible
entity that sets a flag when a Kart drives through. When a Kart crosses the finish line, this flag is checked. If the flag
is not set, this means that the Kart did not pass the checkpoint, so he's cheating. At this point, the kart explodes.

If a kart crosses the finish line, and the checkpoint flag is set, the player is credited with a valid lap, and the flag is 
set back to 0. This means he must again drive through the checkpoint before driving across the finish line. 

The Finish line is also an invisible entity, so feel free to decorate the Finish Line with fancy brushes or what have you.

(A custom QKART.WAD is on the way! There are great start/finish line graphics along with excellent textures for various
road surfaces... clay, dirt, asphalt, etc.)

BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that you place all of the start points PAST the finish line. Remember that drivers must hit the 
checkpoint before the finish line. 


Now the technicalities of these two entities:

The finish line and checkpoint entities are 192 pixels wide. You may make your track as wide or narrow as you wish, but 
the track *MUST* be no wider than 192 pixels at the points where you place the finish line and checkpoint entities. If the 
track is wider than this, any players that are driving very close to the wall may not 'touch' the Checkpoint or Finish line,
this is a bad thing.

Placing the finish line and checkpoint entities:

Try to place the finish line and checkpoint entities in the center of the track. It is CRITICAL that the entity's angle
(facing) point in the direction that traffic will be flowing. For instance, if placing the checkpoint on a straight section
of track that karts will be driving due north on, make sure the entity is facing north also.

To place a finish line, just add an entity with the classname 'kart_finish_line' with your level editor. No extra parameters
are required.

To place a checkpoint, just add an entity with the classname 'kart_checkpoint' with your level editor. No extra parameters 
are required.



POWERUP ITEMS:
--------------
None of the powerup items are completely done yet, so I won't talk about them right now. Just keep powerups in mind when
you build the track, think about where you might place them, etc.


TRACK EFFECTS:
--------------
I'm working now to implement some dynamic effects on the tracks. Right now these are in an infantile stage, so they shouldn't
be considered for placement in tracks yet.


Track Building DO'S & DON'TS:
-----------------------------
DO FORCE drivers to stay on the track. If you are building an area where it will be possible for a kart to fall down between
a launch and landing ramp, try to ensure that they land on another section of track or in lava (hehe). If you do not, build
a lift, ramp, or some other means of getting back onto the track. I suggest using sidewalls on the majority of track 
sections. Be sure you haven't made some way to cheat! Do not make it easier to fly off of the track and drive on at another
point than it is to just run the course. 

DO make the tracks large! By large, I mean surface area... use techniques such as track-over-track, or underground tunnels 
below existing track area to provide plenty of racing area, without pushing the limits of map size. 

DO break your maps up visually. Try not to have any areas from which you can see the entire track. Build walls, bleachers,
buildings, hills, mountains, etc. around the track to limit how much a driver can see at one time. 

DO try to make your corners a little more round than I did in KART3.MAP =)  (see below)

DO incorporate cool stuff. Road hazards are a good idea. Shallow puddles of water in some areas, 'crushers' in tunnels, etc.

DO NOT litter a level with deathtraps. Keep drivers alert, but don't take too much attention away from destroying other 
drivers in the race. 

DO NOT consider KART3.MAP a 'model' level. It sucks, bad... but it serves it's purpose in testing Quake Karts. It was built
for that purpose, not beauty. Note that I did not provide a way to get back on the track when you fall off. Even if you
build sidewalls EVERYWHERE, keep in mind that a missile may blast a kart high into the air, flinging them over your walls
and off of the track. Provide these poor souls with a way to get back to the action should they survive.



For a first revision, this should be plenty of information. Look for the 'kart launcher' patch on Quake Command late evening,
Sunday October 20th. I wanted to have it ready for release with this text, but real life got in the way (again. The nerve!)

If there are any specific topics that I didn't cover in this text file, leave me email and please try to make your question
as clear and detailed as possible.

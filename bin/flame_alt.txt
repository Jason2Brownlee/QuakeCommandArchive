Quake Flamethrower! v1.0

Another amazing Quake Add-On from Quake Command - http://www.nuc.net/quake

9/3/96

QC Code - Wedge (wedge@nuc.net)

=============================================================================

** We are in no way affiliated with ID Software, Inc, the makers of Quake.
Id Software will not provide technical support for this add on.


Here is something that was highly requested, but there was never time to
work on it. Then while we were developing Napalm for the 'Aircraft' project
we got a chance to break away and crank out a flamethrower.

NEW THIS VERSION:
-----------------
Now uses shells instead of rockets for fuel... makes it more appealing.

When someone dies with a flamethrower/grenade launcher, you will get both
weapons from the backpack.

Burning players/monsters now light up the area.

DID NOT Fix the flame's velocity so you can run with the flamethrower. This
was intentionally left in to be a limitation to this weapon.

CENTERPRINTED the "On Fire" warning message now... so even newbies will know
what is going on. :)


Installation:
-------------

1. Make a directory in your QUAKE directory called FLAME

2. Copy PROGS.DAT from this archive to the FLAME directory

3. Start Quake by typing QUAKE -GAME FLAME


Use
---
I was originally going to make the flamethrower go along with the rocket
launcher, but things being the way they are, the rocket launcher is already
the most popular weapon (to some, at least). and everyone scrambles for it,
so I decided to package the Flamethrower with the Grenade Launcher. This means
if you pick up a Grenade Launcher, you automatically get the Flamethrower.

The Flamethrower uses SHELLS for fuel, and uses them quickly. The range is
fairly short, but this weapon is very powerful. The best part is, you can
set people on fire! If you get set on fire by a flamethrower, you better get
yourself to some water or slime >QUICK< If you roast while trying to find
water, whoever set you on fire gets a frag. You may NOT stop-drop-and-roll.
(Sorry Smokey) Be sure to scope the cool bubbles after some human torch peter
pans into the water.

You cannot set yourself on fire with your own flamethrower... sorry.
(I'm sure you don't mind.)

*** To select the flamethrower, select the Grenade Launcher twice. The first
time you hit 6, a message will say "Grenade Launcher" hit 6 again, and it
will print "Flamethrower" (You'll see the onscreen messages) The cycle
weapons command will also select the flamethrower (after the Grenade Launcher)


Notes
-----
There are NO custom models or sounds for this add-on. It would have been cool,
but that would make it harder to implement this patch on servers. When this
weapon becomes part of a multi-patch that has custom sounds or models we will
add them.

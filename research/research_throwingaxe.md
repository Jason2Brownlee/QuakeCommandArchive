> Quake Command (my favorite QC page) has released throwing axes!!!! These are awesome, so you better check them out if you have registered Quake. You always have your normal axe but you can use throwing axes as well by hitting 1 twice. You start with one and can pick up ones from other people. Do you want the compiled version or the source? Also, the guys at Quake Command are working on an aircraft patch which is coming along very well. They already have a lot of screenshots available which look great. And, the source code to ejected shells for the shotguns has been released- this is another patch I really like that should be part of every server.

> Also, I would like to mention that a newer version of my favorite QC patch, throwing axes, has been released. You can get it over at Quake Command [executable / source code] or download it from here [executable / source code]. Read the text file for information about what has been enhanced and fixed. If you haven't seen the throwing axes patch in action yet, I -strongly- recommend it. It's especially fun to play some network deathmatch with an agreement that everyone will only stick to using axes. Anyone who disobeys is ganged up on by everyone else. This was the situation when the author of the patch, Wedge, put up a Quake server for testing the patch a few nights ago. It was great.

> I've watched this one develop for a while, and now it is TRULY cool. Fun in deathamatch also. You can now throw your axe. (you start with 1) you can also pick them up after they have been thrown. they stick in the floor / walls etc.

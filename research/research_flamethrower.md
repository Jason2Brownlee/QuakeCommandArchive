> Quake Command has done it again! They have recently released a flame thrower QuakeC patch. I can't wait to check this out. Unfortunately, I'll have to, cause I got loads of homework to do after I finish the news.. :-(

> I just got around to trying out the flame thrower patch. It is so cool! I like seeing the guys walk around on fire until they burn to death and having it not work underwater is a nice touch. Go get it from Quake Command.

```

The `CONFIG.CFG` file in the acquired version was likely added during re-distribution given the 1997 timestamp.

The release date was September 3 or 4 based on the date in the readme and timestamps in the archive.

It is not clear how the source code was distributed.

The source code did include a file named `flame.qc`, reused and distributed with other mods.

Apologies in advance... I was unable to comment this as well as I'd have
liked to. (I used some weird variable names - hope they don't cause problems.

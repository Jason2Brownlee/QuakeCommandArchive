```

The `CONFIG.CFG` file in the acquired version was likely added during re-distribution given the 1997 timestamp.

The release date was September 3 or 4 based on the date in the readme and timestamps in the archive.

It is not clear how the source code was distributed.

The source code did include a file named `flame.qc`, reused and distributed with other mods.

Here's a file header comment:

Apologies in advance... I was unable to comment this as well as I'd have
liked to. (I used some weird variable names - hope they don't cause problems.
